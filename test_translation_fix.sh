echo "This test verifies that when a Bulgarian word is translated to English,"
echo "the English translation is used for image generation without re-translating."
echo ""
echo "To test manually:"
echo "1. Run: ./totalrecall"
echo "2. Enter a Bulgarian word (e.g., ябълка)"
echo "3. Wait for it to be translated to English (e.g., apple)"
echo "4. Optionally edit the English translation"
echo "5. Click Generate or press Enter"
echo "6. Watch the console output - it should show:"
echo "   'Using provided translation: ябълка -> apple'"
echo "   instead of translating again"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- The image generation uses the translation shown in the UI"
echo "- No additional translation happens during image generation"
echo "- Console shows 'Using provided translation' message"
